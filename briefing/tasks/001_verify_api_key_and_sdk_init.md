# Task 001: Verify API Key Loading & Portal SDK Initialization

**ID:** 001
**Status:** Done
**Priority:** High
**Assignee:** Cline & User
**Related Section in PROJECT_DESCRIPTION_AND_PLAN.md:** Section 2.8.1 (Initial Verification Tests), and new UI feedback requirement from user.
**Version Bump on Completion:** Yes
**Proposed New Version:** 0.0.2

## Description

This task involved two main parts:
1.  Verifying that the Portal SDK is initializing correctly: ensuring the Client API Key is loaded, and the `portal` SDK instance is created without errors.
2.  Implementing a visual indicator in the UI to show the user whether the application has successfully initialized its connection/communication capability with Portal.

This combined the original verification (Test 2.8.1 from `PROJECT_DESCRIPTION_AND_PLAN.md`) with a UI enhancement for better user feedback.

## Objective

1.  Confirm that the `portalClientApiKey` is correctly loaded into `src/portal.ts`.
2.  Confirm that the `portal` object (SDK instance) in `src/portal.ts` is instantiated successfully without runtime errors.
3.  Implement a mechanism to determine and store the Portal SDK initialization status.
4.  Display this status visually in the application's UI (e.g., "Portal: Connected" - Green, "Not Connected to Portal" - Red).

## Steps to Implement & Verify:

**Part 1: Verify SDK Initialization**

1.  **Instrument `src/portal.ts` for Verification:**
    *   [x] Modify `src/portal.ts` to log the `portalClientApiKey` after it's retrieved from `Constants.expoConfig.extra` to confirm it's being loaded correctly.
    *   [x] Ensure that the instantiation of the `Portal` SDK (`new Portal(...)`) is handled in a way that its success or failure can be determined (e.g., by logging success or catching and logging any errors during instantiation).

**Part 2: Implement Connection Status State & UI**

2.  **Enhance `WalletContext` (`src/AuthContext.tsx`) for Portal Connection Status:**
    *   [x] Introduce a new state variable (e.g., `isPortalConnected: boolean | null`, initialized to `null`) to track the Portal SDK initialization status.
    *   [x] After the initial loading of wallet data from `SecureStore` is complete (i.e., `loading` state is `false`), implement logic to check and set the `isPortalConnected` state. This logic should determine if the `portal` instance from `src/portal.ts` was successfully initialized.
    *   [x] Make `isPortalConnected` available through the `WalletContext`.

3.  **Develop and Integrate `PortalStatusIndicator` UI Component:**
    *   [x] Create a new React Native component (e.g., `src/components/PortalStatusIndicator.tsx`).
    *   [x] This component should consume `isPortalConnected` from `WalletContext`.
    *   [x] Render a visual indicator (e.g., a `Text` component) based on the `isPortalConnected` state.
    *   [x] Integrate this `PortalStatusIndicator` component into the main application UI in `App.tsx`.

**Part 3: Testing**

4.  **Run the Application:**
    *   [x] Start the application using `npx expo start` and open it in a development client or simulator.

5.  **Verify Functionality:**
    *   [x] **Console Verification:** Confirm that logs in `src/portal.ts` show the correct API key being loaded and indicate successful instantiation of the Portal SDK.
    *   [x] **UI Verification:**
        *   [x] Observe the `PortalStatusIndicator`. It correctly reflects the SDK initialization status.
        *   [x] Test the "Not Connected" state by temporarily altering conditions that would cause SDK initialization to fail. Ensure the UI updates accordingly and errors are logged.

## Testing Steps & Acceptance Criteria: (Consolidated)

*   [x] Console logs confirm the API key is loaded and the Portal SDK instance is created without errors.
*   [x] A new state `isPortalConnected` is managed in `WalletContext` and correctly reflects SDK initialization status.
*   [x] The UI displays a visual indicator:
    *   "Portal: Connected" (Green text) when the Portal SDK initializes successfully.
    *   "Portal: Not Connected" (Red text) if the Portal SDK fails to initialize.
    *   "Portal: Checking..." (or similar) while the status is being determined.
*   [x] No runtime errors related to Portal SDK instantiation or the new status display.

## Notes:
*   The developer implementing this task should refer to the PortalHQ SDK documentation for details on `Portal` class instantiation, error handling during initialization, and any recommended practices for checking connectivity or SDK readiness.
*   Temporary logging added for verification in `src/portal.ts` was reviewed. (User to decide if it should be removed or refined for permanent debugging).

## Post-Completion Documentation Sub-Tasks:
*   [x] Update `COMPLETED_SETUP_LOG.md` with a summary of this task's completion, including changes made and verification results.
*   [x] Document this task's test(s) (T001.1, T001.2) and their workings in `briefing/TESTS.md`.
*   [x] If version bump is 'Yes', update version in package.json and app.config.ts to the new version (`0.0.2`) and mark this sub-task complete.
*   [ ] Write automated tests (e.g., Jest) for any new/modified logic/components and store in `__tests__/`. (Marked N/A for this task as it primarily involved verification and a simple UI indicator; manual/visual tests were sufficient.)
